# Shopping List with React

[See the page](https://emreozturanli.github.io/Shopping-List/)

I used useReducer hook for the first time with this project. It was a little bit confusing at the beginning but now I am used to it.

### I learned how to use;
  - <b>Components</b>
  - <b>useState</b>
  - <b>useEffect</b>
  - <b>useReducer</b>
  - <b>switch/case</b> within reducer function
  - import/export
  - <b>Props</b>
  - React <b>Developer Tool</b>
  - Destructuring props
  - array <b>map</b> method
  - <b>setInterval</b> function.
  
User can add items to the list, remove items from the list. User will be informed after every action with the help of alert box I created.
